                        <h2 className=' text-2xl font-semibold'>How Malegra Effervescent Functions</h2>
                        <p className=' text-xl'>Sildenafil citrate inhibits the PDE-5 enzyme, leading to increased levels of cGMP in the penile tissue. This process relaxes smooth muscle and dilates blood vessels in the penis, enhancing blood flow and facilitating an erection when sexually stimulated. The effects of Malegra Effervescent can last between 4 to 6 hours, providing ample time for satisfactory sexual engagement.</p>
